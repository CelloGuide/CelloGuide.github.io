    <!--Here is section one: My Cello Journey-->
    <h2 id="my-journey">My Cello Journey</h2>
    <p>I was introduced to the cello by my elementary school when I was eleven. I had already been playing the piano for five years, but I did not know much about string instruments. Hoping to take on another instrument, I joined the strings class as a cello player. The instrument was very insteresting to me because it is much different from the piano, so my parents found me a private cello teacher. I enjoyed my classes very much and often practiced my Suzuki pieces for many hours a day. When I entered middle school, I decided that I was going to be serious with the cello. I auditioned and got in the Berkeley Youth Orchestra (6th grade) and the Oakland Symphony Youth Orchestra (7th grade) while playing as assistant principal cello at the school strings orchestra. I won international competitions such as the United States Open International Competition and the Kings Peak International Music Competition along with numerous others within the United States. I love this instrument and always look forward to learning more about it in the future.</p>

    <!--This section talks about the parts of a cello-->
    <h2 id="parts">Parts of a Cello</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scroll: The scroll is the very top of the cello. It is a piece of carved wood that connects to the peg box.</li> 
        <li>Peg box: The peg box holds all the pegs.</li>
        <li>Pegs: Pegs are used for tuning the cello. They are big and often times hard to turn, so cellists don't use pegs unless absolutely necessary. We use fine tuners instead, which is defined later.</li>
        <li>Neck: The neck of a cello holds the fingerboard and the strings.</li>
        <li>Fingerboard: The fingerboard, which sits on top of the neck, is where the fingers go when playing the instrument. </li>
        <li>Strings: There are four strings on a cello (five string cellos can be used for Baroque music, but they are very rare nowadays) A, D, G, C, going from high to low respectively. The strings allow cellists to play a large range from notes. There are many different string brands to choose from; it's fun to experiment with different types and find those that match your cello the best.</li>
        <li>F holes: The F holes are the two "f" shaped holes on the body of the cello. These holes allow air to flow in and out of the cello for sound production.</li>
        <li>Bridge: The bridge holds the strings in place.</li>
        <li>Tail piece: The end of the strings are connected to the tail piece which also holds the fine tuners.</li>
        <li>Fine tuners: These are the tuners that cellists use all the time. Cellos get out of tune very easily, just like any other string instrument, so cellists tune every time they practice. Once you get good at it, regular tuning takes less than a minute!</li>
        <li>Endpin: The end pin connects the cello to the floor. The length of the end pin is adjustable so that the instrument is at a comfortable place for your height. (Fun fact, Baroque cellos did not have endpins.)</li>
        <li>Bow: Typically made out of horse hair and wood, cellists use the bow on the strings to produce music.</li> 
    </ul>

    <!--This section talks about the role of the cello in different groups.-->
    <h2 id="role">The Role of the Cello</h2>
    <h3>Solo<a href=#repertoire>(repertoire list)</a></h3>
    <p>There are many solo repertoires for the cello. Sonatas, typically three to four movements, are accompanied by pianos. Concertos are also three to four movements, but they are accompanied by orchestras. Grand and stunning, they are played in big concert halls around the world. There are solo pieces without accompaniments, with Bach's six suites being the heart of the cello repertoire to many cellists. Other pieces that don't fix in any of these categories include <em>The Swan, Hungarian Rhapsody, Paganini: Variations on one string, </em>etc.</p>
    <h3>Chamber Music</h3>
    <h3>Orchestra</h3>
    <p>The cello and the bass are the two string instruments that have the lowest sound. You might have heard people say that the cello sounds the most like the human voice. Because of its warm and low sound, cellos usually play the bass line and harmony of orchestral music to achieve balance in sound with the other instruments. Occasionally, cellos get melodies that are played by a few of the 8-12 cellists. A famous example is the violin & cello duet in the 2th movement of Dvorak's 9th symphony.</p>
